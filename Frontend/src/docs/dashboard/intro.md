The Dashboard provides a web interface to visualize and manage datasets and their complete traceability.

## What You Can See

- **Version chains** — Complete DAG of all dataset versions
- **Anchored states** — Last state recorded on Sui blockchain
- **Node health** — Integrity scores and reputations in real-time
- **Reproducibility receipts** — Links between AI models and data versions

## Key Features

- **Visual DAG** — Interactive graph of version relationships
- **Real-time monitoring** — Live updates of node status
- **Search and filter** — Find datasets, versions, or receipts quickly
- **Export capabilities** — Download proofs and audit trails

The Dashboard makes it easy to understand which version of a dataset is canonical at any given time and verify the complete history of changes.
