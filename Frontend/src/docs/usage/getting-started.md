# Getting Started

## Quick Start

Sirius adds observability, governance, and attestation layers on top of distributed storage systems.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a distributed storage system (e.g., Walrus)
- Access to Sui blockchain (testnet or mainnet)
- Node.js 18+ (for the dashboard)

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations

# Start services
npm run start
```

## First Steps

1. **Configure storage** — Connect to your storage system
2. **Deploy smart contracts** — Deploy on Sui
3. **Initialize Data Layer** — Set up versioning
4. **Start AI Layer** — Enable monitoring
5. **Access Dashboard** — Visualize your data
